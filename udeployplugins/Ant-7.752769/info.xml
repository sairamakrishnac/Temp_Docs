  <!-- Do not change the release-version, the build process injects it. -->
  <release-version>7.752769</release-version>

  <release-notes>
    <!--
      **release-note IS required**

      The plugin-version name must match the plugin version found in the plugin.xml file

      The release-note should document the changes, improvements, or bug fixes introduced
      with the new plugin version

      The release-note may contain text or reference a file in the plugin zip package

      For example your release note could be:
      Support for was added for version 10.0 for software X
      or
      releaseNotes/release1.html (where release1.html contains html formatted version information)

      To add a new release note add this with a description in it of the changes:
      <release-note plugin-version="1">....</release-note>

      Our automated release process will replace 'LATEST' with the released version.

      If this already exists in the file, then the described changes have not been released yet and
      you should just append to the existing 'LATEST' tag.
